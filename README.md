## Introduction
This repository contains code for controlling an xARM robot.

## Overall Process
Each student has a folder with thier name. All of the work by a specific student needs to be in their folder. Once a student has receieved confirmation from the other two students, that they have tested and approved a specific program, it can be moved to the **Final** folder.

## Git Process
The process of using git is the following:
1. Edit files for a period of time or to a specific working condition.
2. `git add -A` to **stage** the changed files to git
3. `git commit -m "description of changes` to **commit** the changes to git
4. `git push` to **push** the files upto the github repository

If you want to see some of the changes made by other students, you will need to *fetch and merge* those changes:

1. `git fetch` - will *fetch* or download the latest changes in the *GitHub* repository
2. `git merge` - will *merge* the changes into the repository on your computer
